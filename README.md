# Rainfall-Prediction-Model
This model leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast daily rainfall based on historical weather data. By capturing temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships among features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, the model predicts next-day rainfall intensity with high accuracy.
